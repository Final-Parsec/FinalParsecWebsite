She's an undergrad student at University of Texas at Dallas working on an &lt;a href="http://learningpygame.blogspot.com/"&gt;educational blog&lt;/a&gt; all about game programming with Python and PyGame.
Final Parsec's first foray into game programming was our attempt to build Space Snakes with PyGame.
Even if we have moved toward Unity and C# for most of our development, we've got some experience with the library and still have a strong passion for Python.
Needless to say, we were interested and I reached out to Sharon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This culminated in a great interview which you can listen to right here. If you'd rather read, the transcript is included as well.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;source src="/theme/audio/PyGameInterview.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; Hello everyone!  My name is Sharon Lougheed, and I'm a student at The University of Texas at Dallas.  And I'm interviewing an awesome team of game developers from a company called Final Parsec.  Would you guys like to introduce yourselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TJ:&lt;/strong&gt; Sure!  My name is TJ Brosnan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt:&lt;/strong&gt; And I'm Matt Bauer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baer:&lt;/strong&gt; And my name is Baer Bradford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; Okay, so what do you guys do at your team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TJ:&lt;/strong&gt; We try and make games on our spare time.  It started out as sort of a tool to start learning a new software language called Python.  And from there, we just kind of took on it because we had so much fun to start trying to do new games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; Are you guys all programmers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baer:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, we're all programmers and developers.  We all went to TCU and majored in computer science.  And that's actually been kind of one of the downfalls of our triumvirate I think is that we lack really badly for art and audio kind of work.  But we definitely manage the programming side very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; So how and when did you first learn Python?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baer:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, for me, I actually started learning Python for my job.  I was working at a company and we were using it to build websites with the framework called Flask.  And we dug pretty deep into it, but not quite in the same way when I met with Matt and TJ and started working on Space Snakes.  How did you guys-- When did you get into Python?  This was the first time you guys started working with it, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TJ:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, I also got into it for a job.  I actually wanted to try and make a game with Python in order to use it as a tool to learn it so I could do some scripting for my internship at one of the companies I was working for at TCU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt:&lt;/strong&gt; And TJ recruited me shortly after deciding to make a game, and I just wanted to do that.  So that's all-- that was the only reason.  I had no reason to do it for a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TJ:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, and thn Matt kind of took it away and spent hours and hours doing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.  I stayed up all night a few nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; So I understand you were using Pygame when you were working on Space Snakes.  Could you tell us a bit about it, and how would you describe the experience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TJ:&lt;/strong&gt; I think Matt has a lot to say about Pygame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah... So Pygame it was a lot of fun developing.  It really gets very close to the OpenGL type of programming without actually having to do OpenGL.  And you don't get a lot of the hand-holding that other game engines like Unreal and Unity 3D do for you.  But at the same time, you have to actually have to program all those things yourself.  So you're spending a lot of time implementing things that have been done thousands of times by other people.  So I really liked it as a learning tool, and it was great to get into.  But after we actually made the switch over to Unity 3D, we just found all these things that we had actually programmed ourselves were just done automatically for us.  So that was pretty nice, and it was a lot easier than chugging through Pygame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; So I'm going to guess that's why you had difficulty finishing the game?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah.  So we got very far.  We did a whole lot of work, and we finally started to do the multiplayer/networking aspect of our game, and we just realized that it was going to take us probably another year to get anywhere close to what we wanted and what we were going to expect from it.  And that's about whenever I started looking for other engines and saw-- just ran across this tutorial that basically did what we wanted to do in about 10 hours.  And it's like, well... we could do this for another months, or we could learn Unity 3D and could probably be done in a couple of weeks, so that when I started making the switch over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; For a team that doesn't have art or music people, Space Snakes looks like a pretty cool game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TJ:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, well we were actually able to recruit my friend for some of the art on Space Snakes.  Actually most of it he was able to put together for us, but he was pretty unreliable, and his work kind of tapered off towards the end of the project.  So in our newer games we had to dip into free and open game art and stuff like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; Ah, I see.  Alright... What advice do you have for those who are new to Pygame or game development in general?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baer:&lt;/strong&gt; My advice would actually be to try to start a smaller scale game than something like Space Snakes.  Don't envision that you're going to build a game that has different types of levels and multiplayer and half a dozen different weapons and lobby systems and all kinds of things like that.  It's probably much better for you to try to start with something smaller and then build your way up in subsequent games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TJ:&lt;/strong&gt; Also, when you do start small like that, you start reusing your code over and over.  So, like, you don't have to rebuild your lobby system or your menu system.  You just go and copy that over and change all the art around and apply all those concepts to your new game, and each game kind of builds on itself after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baer:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah definitely.  If you're designing your games right, you'll be getting reusable components that you can use elsewhere for a long time in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TJ:&lt;/strong&gt; Another piece of advice that I would give for Pygame in particular is to look at the Python...  What did you call it Baer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baer:&lt;/strong&gt; It's &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"&gt;PEP8&lt;/a&gt;.  And PEP stands for... I can't actually remember off the top of my head, but it's pretty much a Python standard or convention and PEP8 refers to how everything is formatted and organized and it really helps the readability of your code, which is a big advantage of writing in Python to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TJ:&lt;/strong&gt; It was, yeah.  Baer came into Space Snakes like a couple months after Matt and I started, and soon as he got here we started switching things over to how he did it at his job to PEP8, and things started to click much faster and it looked better too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, my friend mentioned that, and I was wondering should-- is it a good idea to start programming according to PEP8?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baer:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolutely.  I would get into the habit as soon as you can because it's not-- If you're working on a single project by yourself, it's not going to be such a big deal, but as soon as you get into a team environment, following conventions is going to be one of the most valuable things you can do.  And having it as second-nature will make it so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; Alright.  Oh... I'm going to have to go back in my code and change it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baer:&lt;/strong&gt; If you look around, there are actually development environments that will highlight your code that doesn't follow that standard.  We all personally use &lt;a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/"&gt;PyCharm&lt;/a&gt;.  It's not a free piece of software, but it's one of the better development environments we've found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TJ:&lt;/strong&gt; I believe they have a free version out now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baer:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh yeah, I think they might have a community edition, and it'll go through and tell you if you're not following the appropriate conventions and tell you exactly what you're doing wrong, which is really convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, sweet!  That sounds pretty helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TJ:&lt;/strong&gt; Did you have any advice Matt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt:&lt;/strong&gt; Mmm, nah.  I think y'all covered all the good ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharon:&lt;/strong&gt; Well I think that's all the questions I have for you today, and thank you so much for agreeing to do this interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you liked this, I encourage you to take a look at &lt;a href="http://learningpygame.blogspot.com/"&gt;Sharon's blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="snakes"></category><category term="pygame"></category></entry><entry><title>Caching and Apache</title><link href="/caching-and-apache.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2015-02-23T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Baer</name></author><id>tag:,2015-02-23:caching-and-apache.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As you may or may not have noticed, our website is entirely comprised of static files.
We do this despite the fact that our site has a large amount of somewhat dynamic content (for instance, the blog you're reading right now).
This is accomplished by using a static site generator (&lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;) and letting Apache serve the output straight off the file system.
The primary benefits include:
&lt;ul class=default&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Tracking changes and entire history of the site is as easy as keeping it under version control.&lt;/li&gt; 
    &lt;li&gt;No server side scripting or processing to speak of.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;We don't need to query a database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
These last two help cut down on the response time when a user requests content which is vitally important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One side effect of taking this approach is that browsers can pretty aggressively cache the resources that compose your site.
This can either be a really good or really bad thing depending on the nature of your site.
Browsers caching your content can result in very quick render times, but users may be looking at stale content.
As I mention earlier in the article, our site changes frequently as we update it with new posts and such.
This means a user seeing stale content is a problem for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several ways you can tell a browser to avoid caching (or at least check for an updated version) primarily through the use of HTTP headers.
The header we're going to be interested in is the &lt;strong&gt;cache-control&lt;/strong&gt; header.
A few others headers exist to manipulate caching behavior. If you want to dive into more information, &lt;a href="http://www.mobify.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-http-cache-headers/"&gt;take a look at this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the Apache module &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_expires.html"&gt;mod_expires&lt;/a&gt; to manipulate this header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to enabling this module, you'll want to add rules to your virtual host file (you can also put this configuration information in &lt;strong&gt;.htaccess&lt;/strong&gt;).
Our rules allow clients to cache content for 1 month with the exception of &lt;strong&gt;html&lt;/strong&gt; files.
These expire immediately requiring the browser to check with our server before using a cached version of the content.
Using this strategy, we get the benefits of caching where it matters (larger files like images and frequently requested files like CSS) while getting the guarantee users will always see fresh content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class='apply-line-numbers'&gt;&lt;code class='hljs apache'&gt;&amp;lt;IfModule mod_expires.c&amp;gt;
    ExpiresActive on
    ExpiresDefault          "access plus 1 month"

    ExpiresByType text/html "access plus 0 seconds"
&amp;lt;/IfModule&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've modified your configuration, enable the mod_expires module.
&lt;pre class='apply-line-numbers'&gt;&lt;code class='hljs bash'&gt;&lt;/code&gt;sudo a2enmod expires&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then restart apache to ensure your changes take effect.
&lt;pre class='apply-line-numbers'&gt;&lt;code class='hljs bash'&gt;&lt;/code&gt;sudo service apache2 restart&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="web-dev"></category><category term="tutorial"></category><category term="apache"></category><category term="cache"></category></entry><entry><title>Aurora TD Released on Web and Android Devices!</title><link href="/tower-defense-release.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-12-22T00:00:00-06:00</updated><author><name>Baer</name></author><id>tag:,2014-12-22:tower-defense-release.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
    Aurora Tower Defense has just been released for PC, Mac, and Android devices.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;
    Aurora TD costs $2.49 on Android, but you can play the full featured game for free online.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;
    Just head over to &lt;a href="/category/tower-defense.html"&gt;the Aurora TD category&lt;/a&gt; and play right in your web browser!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    You are an Inuit shaman sworn to protect Tomkin, the home of the spirits.
    Tonrar, the evil spirit, is attempting to bring darkness to the ice caps.
    You must repel his forces by building totems, magical defenses which are empowered by the elements.
    As the evil forces grow in strength and numbers, darkness will overtake the northern lights.
    Fight back by strategically placing totem poles with magical abilities!
    Invoke the power of the spirits!
    Salaksartok! 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Aurora TD is an isometric tower defense game involving strategy and quick wit.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Watch our trailer below to get an idea of how the game works.

    Learn how to make turrets detect enemies and shoot projectiles at them.
    A continuation of the tower defense tutorial series.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setting Up Your Turret GameObject&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Go ahead and get started by creating a Sprite in your hierarchy.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    This should create a new &lt;a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GameObject.html" target="_blank"&gt;GameObject&lt;/a&gt; 
    with the &lt;a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Transform.html" target="_blank"&gt;Transform&lt;/a&gt; and 
    &lt;a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SpriteRenderer.html" target="_blank"&gt;Sprite Renderer&lt;/a&gt; components        
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  
    Don't worry too much about changing the position; we're going to be setting that programmatically when the player tries to place a turret on the map.
    Do, however, add some cool art to the Sprite property of your renderer.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span class="caption"&gt;This is what we're using for our Earth Type Turrets. Maybe one day we'll hire an artist...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;img src="/theme/images/tower_defense_enemy_detection_and_firing_earth_turret_art.png"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Attach a MonoBehavior script and call it &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;Turret.cs&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Attach a &lt;a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-SphereCollider.html" target="_blank"&gt;Sphere Collider&lt;/a&gt; too.
    Make sure the &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;Is Trigger&lt;/span&gt; property is checked.
    Don't worry about changing values for &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;Center&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;Radius&lt;/span&gt;
    as we'll be changing these programmatically.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;img src="/theme/images/tower_defense_enemy_detection_and_firing_earth_turret_components.png"&gt;
    &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Your GameObject's components should look something like this.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Go ahead and create a prefab by dragging the turret from your scene to a directory in the project tab.
    Having our turrets as prefabs will give the benefit of being able to instantiate them from code.
    We can even create multiple prefabs which will allow for different turret types, each with their own stats, special abilities, and artwork.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Writing the Scripts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Open up the &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;Turret.cs&lt;/span&gt; attached to your prefab. It should look something like this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class='apply-line-numbers'&gt;&lt;code class='hljs cs'&gt;using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

public class Turret : MonoBehaviour
{

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {

    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update () {

    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Take note I've added a couple &lt;span class='hljs-keyword'&gt;using&lt;/span&gt; statements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Let's add some fields and properties. Keep in mind the public fields will be accessible in Unity's inspector panel. 
    &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;damage&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;rateOfFire&lt;/span&gt; are all meant to adjusted there on a 0-10 scale.
    The associated properties &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;AttackDelay&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;DetectionRadius&lt;/span&gt; scale those values to based on the size of the map.
    &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;DetectionRadius&lt;/span&gt; also takes responsibility for changing the size of the attached sphere collider. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class='apply-line-numbers'&gt;&lt;code class='hljs cs'&gt;// Configurable
public float accuracyError = 2.0f;
public int damage = 10;
public GameObject projectileType;
public int range = 5;
public int rateOfFire = 5;

// Constants
private const float MinAttackDelay = 0.1f;
private const float MaxAttackDelay = 2f;

// Internal
private List&lt;EnemyBase&gt; myTargets;
private float nextDamageEvent;
private ObjectManager objectManager;    
private static readonly object syncRoot = new object ();

// Properties
private float AttackDelay
{
    get 
    {
        int inverted = rateOfFire;
        if (rateOfFire == 0) 
        { 
            return float.MaxValue;
        }
        else if (rateOfFire &lt; 5)
        {
            inverted = rateOfFire + 2 * (5 - rateOfFire);
        }
        else if (rateOfFire &gt; 5) 
        {
            inverted = rateOfFire - 2 * (rateOfFire - 5);
        }

        return (((float)inverted - 1f) / (10f - 1f)) * (MaxAttackDelay - MinAttackDelay) + .1f;
    }
}

public float DetectionRadius
{ 
    get 
    {   
        float minRange = Mathf.Min(objectManager.Map.nodeSize.x, objectManager.Map.nodeSize.y) * 1.5f;
        float maxRange = minRange * 4f;

        float detectionRadius = (((float)range - 1f) / (10f - 1f)) * (maxRange - minRange) + minRange;
        detectionRadius = detectionRadius / transform.localScale.x;

        return detectionRadius;
    }
    set 
    {
        float minRange = Mathf.Min(objectManager.Map.nodeSize.x, objectManager.Map.nodeSize.y) * 1.5f;
        float maxRange = minRange * 4f;

        float detectionRadius = (((float)value - 1f) / (10f - 1f)) * (maxRange - minRange) + minRange;
        detectionRadius = detectionRadius / transform.localScale.x;

        SphereCollider collider = transform.GetComponent&lt;SphereCollider&gt; ();
        collider.radius = detectionRadius;
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Here we initialize some of those private fields.
    &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;objectManager&lt;/span&gt; is just a singleton we are using to help maintain game state.
    Matt talks more in-depth about it in some of the earlier videos from the &lt;a href="/tag/td-video-series.html"&gt;Tower Defense Tutorial Video Series&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class='apply-line-numbers'&gt;&lt;code class='hljs cs'&gt;// Runs when entity is Instantiated
void Awake()
{
    objectManager = ObjectManager.GetInstance();
    objectManager.AddEntity(this);
}

// Use this for initialization
void Start ()
{
    DetectionRadius = range;
    myTargets = new List&lt;EnemyBase&gt;();
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    These two methods track when enemies enter and exit the attached sphere collider.
    At any given time, &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;myTargets&lt;/span&gt; should now reflect all enemies inside the sphere, the turret's detectable area.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class='apply-line-numbers'&gt;&lt;code class='hljs cs'&gt;void OnTriggerEnter (Collider other)
{
    if (other.gameObject.tag == "enemy") {  
        myTargets.Add (other.GetComponent&lt;EnemyBase&gt;());
    }
}

void OnTriggerExit (Collider other)
{
    lock (syncRoot) {
        if (other != null &amp;&amp;
            myTargets.Select (t =&gt; t!= null &amp;&amp; t.gameObject).Contains(other.gameObject)) {
            myTargets.Remove (other.GetComponent&lt;EnemyBase&gt;());
        }
    }

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Killing Dudes with Projectiles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    In order to create a projectile, create a new &lt;a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GameObject.html" target="_blank"&gt;GameObject&lt;/a&gt; starting with as a sphere. 
    I ended up adding a &lt;a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-MeshRenderer.html" target="_blank"&gt;Mesh Renderer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-LineRenderer.html" target="_blank"&gt;Line Renderer&lt;/a&gt; to get it to look like a bullet.
    Attach a MonoBehavior script called &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;Projectile.cs&lt;/span&gt;.
    Go ahead and make a prefab from this object the same way you did for turrets.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
     Nothing too crazy going on in this script.
     It requires a target enemy (and associated location) and just homes in on it until it "hits".
     We're not doing any collision detection here, but rather checking distance between the projectile and its target.
     Once the projectile reaches the target, it destroys itself and damages the enemy by subtracting from its health. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class='apply-line-numbers'&gt;&lt;code class='hljs cs'&gt;using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class Projectile : MonoBehaviour
{
    // Configurable
    public float range;
    public float speed;
    public EnemyBase target;
    public Vector3 targetPosition;

    public int Damage { get; set; }

    // Internal
    private float distance;

    // Runs when entity is Instantiated
    void Awake ()
    {
        distance = 0;
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update ()
    {
        Vector3 moveVector = new Vector3 (transform.position.x - targetPosition.x,
                                         transform.position.y - targetPosition.y,
                                         transform.position.z - targetPosition.z).normalized;

        // update the position
        transform.position = new Vector3 (transform.position.x - moveVector.x * speed * Time.deltaTime,
                                         transform.position.y - moveVector.y * speed * Time.deltaTime,
                                         transform.position.z - moveVector.z * speed * Time.deltaTime);

        distance += Time.deltaTime * speed;

        if (distance &gt; range ||
            Vector3.Distance (transform.position, new Vector3 (targetPosition.x, targetPosition.y, targetPosition.z)) &lt; 1) 
        {
            Destroy (gameObject);
            if (target != null) 
            {
                target.Damage (Damage);
            }
        }
    }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Now that projectiles are good to go, drag that new projectile prefab onto the &lt;span style='font-weight: bold;'&gt;projectileType&lt;/span&gt; field (in the inspector when you've got a turret selected).
    Next, you'll need the following two methods to make the turret "fire" projectiles.
    All we're doing is setting up a loop where the turret instantiates new projectiles targeted at a random enemy within range.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class='apply-line-numbers'&gt;&lt;code class='hljs cs'&gt;void Fire (EnemyBase myTarget)
{
    var targetPosition = myTarget.transform.position;
    var aimError = Random.Range (-accuracyError, accuracyError);
    var aimPoint = new Vector3 (targetPosition.x + aimError, targetPosition.y + aimError, targetPosition.z + aimError);
    nextDamageEvent = Time.time + AttackDelay;
    GameObject projectileObject = Instantiate (projectileType, transform.position, Quaternion.LookRotation (targetPosition)) as GameObject;
    Projectile projectile = projectileObject.GetComponent&lt;Projectile&gt; ();
    projectile.Damage = damage;
    projectile.target = myTarget;
    projectile.targetPosition = aimPoint;
}

// Update is called once per frame
void Update ()
{
    lock(syncRoot)
    {
        if (myTargets.Any())
        {
            EnemyBase myTarget = myTargets.ElementAt(Random.Range(0, myTargets.Count));


            if (myTarget != null) {
                if (Time.time &gt;= nextDamageEvent)
                {
                    Fire(myTarget);
                }
            }
            else
            {
                nextDamageEvent = Time.time + AttackDelay;
                myTargets.Remove(myTarget);
            }              
        }
    }       
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    To fill in some of the gaps like placing turrets on the map and spawning enemies, I encourage you to go take a look at some of the earlier videos from the &lt;a href="/tag/td-video-series.html"&gt;Tower Defense Tutorial Video Series&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="tower-defense"></category><category term="unity"></category><category term="tutorial"></category><category term="turret"></category></entry><entry><title>Deploying Unity Games to Android</title><link href="/unity-deploying-to-android.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-09-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Baer</name></author><id>tag:,2014-09-21:unity-deploying-to-android.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;
    In this tutorial, learn how to deploy your Unity game to an Android device.    
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Install the Java Development Kit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/" target="_blank"&gt;Download the JDK from Oracle&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Install the JDK. Grab the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;32-bit version&lt;/span&gt;; I wasn't able to get Unity to work with the 64-bit alternative.        
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    
    Include java's &lt;code&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt; directory in your PATH variable. 
    On my 64-bit Win8 install, the path was &lt;code&gt;"C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jdk1.8.0_20\bin"&lt;/code&gt;.
    Yours will likely be something similar.     
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;span class="caption"&gt;You should now be able to run "java" at the command line.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;img src="/theme/images/unity_deploying_with_android_java_command_prompt.png"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Install the Android SDK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk" target="_blank"&gt;Download the Android SDK&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
    Unpack the SDK. 
    Some of the names in this bundle can be quite long. 
    So if you're on Windows, be careful about limitations on total path lengths.
    I got around this by unpacking to &lt;code&gt;"C:\A\"&lt;/code&gt;, a shorter than usual path.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Navigate to that directory, run the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;SDK Manager&lt;/span&gt; and make sure you've got the following installed:

    &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;An Android platform (2.3 or newer)&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Platform tools&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;USB drivers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;img src="/theme/images/unity_deploying_with_android_android_sdk_manager.png"&gt;
    &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Here's what I've got installed.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Setup the Device&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    To allow unsigned Android application packages (APKs) on your device, you'll need to modify some settings. 
    Go to &lt;code&gt;Settings -&gt; Developer options&lt;/code&gt;.
    On Android 4.2 (Jelly Bean) and higher, these options have been hidden and adding them to the menu requires extra steps:

     &lt;ol&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;code&gt;Settings -&gt; About Phone&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Find &lt;code&gt;Build Number&lt;/code&gt; and tap it 7 times.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;You should see a message confirming you as a developer.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
     Once you get into the developer options, enable &lt;code&gt;USB Debugging&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Allow Mock Locations&lt;/code&gt;.
     &lt;img src="/theme/images/unity_deploying_with_android_developer_options.png"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Plug in your device over USB, and you should see a message like "USB debugging connected".
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="font-size: smaller;"&gt;
    &lt;span style="font:smaller;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Heads up:&lt;/span&gt;
    some devices will need additional manufacturer specific drivers. 
    As an example, I needed &lt;a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html" target="_blank"&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; for my Nexus 5. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Build and Run from Unity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Start Unity. Go to &lt;code&gt;Edit -&gt; Preferences -&gt; External Tools&lt;/code&gt;.
    Point the &lt;code&gt;Android SDK Location&lt;/code&gt; to the appropriate location (&lt;code&gt;"C:\A\adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20140702\sdk"&lt;/code&gt; in my case). 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Go to &lt;code&gt;File -&gt; Build Settings&lt;/code&gt;.
    Select &lt;code&gt;Android&lt;/code&gt; and click the &lt;code&gt;Player Settings&lt;/code&gt; button.
    Set everything up the way you'd like. The &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Bundle Identifer&lt;/span&gt; setting is required and should follow &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_package#Package_naming_conventions" target="_blank"&gt;conventions&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;code&gt;com.finalparsec.towerdefense&lt;/code&gt; for example).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
    Select &lt;code&gt;Build And Run&lt;/code&gt;, select a location for your .apk, and the game should start up on your device.
&lt;/p&gt;
